# stringpool

The goal of stringpool is to help developers understand R's global string pool.

## Installation

You can install the development version of stringpool like so:

``` r
pak::pak("krlmlr/stringpool")
```

## Example

```{r example}
library(stringpool)
```

Use `stringpool()` to get all strings currently known to R as a character vector:

```{r head}
lapply(head(stringpool()), charToRaw)
```

If you need to understand the evolution of the global string table, writing to disk is a good idea. 

```{r write}
path1 <- tempfile(fileext = ".txt")
write_stringpool(path1, sep = "=====\n")
fs::file_info(path1)

path2 <- tempfile(fileext = ".txt")
write_stringpool(path2, sep = "=====\n")
fs::file_info(path2)
```
